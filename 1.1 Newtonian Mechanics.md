## 1.1 Newton's Law of Motion

---

### Newton's First Law of Motion (Law of Inertia)

**Statement:**  
An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion continues in motion at a constant velocity unless acted upon by a net external force.

**Equation:**  
There is no direct formula, but for constant velocity or rest:  

$$
\sum F = 0
$$

**Examples:**
- A book lying on a table stays at rest until someone pushes it.  
- A hockey puck sliding on ice eventually stops due to friction.  
- Passengers in a car lurch forward when the car suddenly stops (inertia).  

**Practice Problems:**  
1. A soccer ball is at rest on a field. A player kicks it with a force of 50 N. If no other forces act on it, what will happen to the ball according to Newton’s first law?  
2. Explain why passengers lurch forward in a car when it suddenly stops.  

---

### Newton's Second Law of Motion

**Statement:**  
The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.

**Equation:**  

$$
\vec{F} = m \vec{a}
$$

Where:  
- $F$ = net force (N)  
- $m$ = mass (kg)  
- $a$ = acceleration (m/s²)  

**Examples:**  
- A 10 kg box is pushed with a force of 20 N. Its acceleration is:  

$$
a = \frac{F}{m} = \frac{20}{10} = 2 \ \text{m/s}^2
$$

**Practice Problems:**  
1. A 5 kg object is accelerated at 4 m/s². Find the net force acting on it.  
2. A car of mass 800 kg accelerates at 2 m/s². What is the force applied?  
3. A 50 N force is applied on a 10 kg object. What is its acceleration?  

---

### Newton's Third Law of Motion

**Statement:**  
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

**Equation:**  

$$
F_{\text{action}} = -F_{\text{reaction}}
$$

**Examples:**  
- When you jump off a boat, the boat moves backward as you move forward.  
- A rocket pushes gases backward, and the rocket moves forward.  
- A swimmer pushes water backward with a force of 200 N, and the water pushes the swimmer forward with 200 N.  

**Practice Problems:**  
1. A swimmer pushes water backward with a force of 200 N. What is the force pushing the swimmer forward?  
2. Two ice skaters push each other away. Skater A has mass 50 kg, Skater B has mass 70 kg. If Skater A moves at 3 m/s, what is the speed of Skater B? *(Hint: use momentum conservation)*  

##   Momentum Shortcuts with Examples

### 1. Push-Apart from Rest (Simple Shortcut)
If two objects start at rest and push apart:

$$
v_B = \frac{m_A}{m_B} v_A
$$

* Then add a **negative sign** to show the opposite direction.  
- Works only when **initial momentum = 0**.

**Example:**  
Two skaters push off each other from rest.  
- Skater A: \(m_A = 30 \, \text{kg}\), \(v_A = +4 \, \text{m/s}\)  
- Skater B: \(m_B = 60 \, \text{kg}\), \(v_B = ?\)  

Solution:  
$$
v_B = \frac{30}{60}(4) = 2 \quad \Rightarrow v_B = -2 \, \text{m/s}
$$

---

### 2. Same Start Velocity, One Final Velocity Known
If two objects start moving together with velocity \(v_0\), and one final velocity is given:

$$
v_{\text{other}} = v_0 + \frac{m_{\text{known}}}{m_{\text{other}}} (v_0 - v_{\text{known final}})
$$

* Just take the initial velocity and **add the weighted share of the velocity change**.  

**Example:**  
A car (\(1000 \, \text{kg}\)) and trailer (\(500 \, \text{kg}\)) move together at \(20 \, \text{m/s}\).  
The trailer slows to \(10 \, \text{m/s}\).  
Find the car’s final velocity.  

Solution:  
$$
v_{\text{car}} = 20 + \frac{500}{1000}(20 - 10)
$$
$$
v_{\text{car}} = 20 + 0.5(10) = 25 \, \text{m/s}
$$

---

### 3. Throwing / Ejecting Something
If a person/astronaut throws an object while drifting:

$$
v_{\text{person final}} = v_0 + \frac{m_{\text{object}}}{m_{\text{person}}} (v_0 - v_{\text{object final}})
$$

* Same logic as above, but person vs object.  

**Example:**  
An astronaut (\(80 \, \text{kg}\)) drifts at \(+2 \, \text{m/s}\).  
He throws a \(20 \, \text{kg}\) tool backward at \(-5 \, \text{m/s}\).  
Find astronaut’s final velocity.  

Solution:  
$$
v_{\text{astronaut}} = 2 + \frac{20}{80}(2 - (-5))
$$
$$
v_{\text{astronaut}} = 2 + 0.25(7) = 2 + 1.75 = 3.75 \, \text{m/s}
$$

---

### 4. Collisions (Stick Together, Inelastic)
If two objects collide and stick together:

$$
v_{\text{final}} = \frac{m_A v_A + m_B v_B}{m_A + m_B}
$$

* This is just the **weighted average of their velocities**.  

**Example:**  
A \(2 \, \text{kg}\) cart moving at \(+3 \, \text{m/s}\) collides and sticks to a \(4 \, \text{kg}\) cart at rest.  
Find their final velocity.  

Solution:  
$$
v_{\text{final}} = \frac{2(3) + 4(0)}{2+4}
$$
$$
v_{\text{final}} = \frac{6}{6} = 1 \, \text{m/s}
$$

---

  **Pro Tip:**
- Use **Shortcut 1** for simple push-offs from rest.  
- Use **Shortcut 2/3** for cases with a shared start velocity.  
- Use **Shortcut 4** for collisions where they stick together.  
- If things get more complicated (elastic collisions with rebounds), go back to the **full momentum conservation law**.

## 1.2 Linear Motion / Kinematics


Kinematics is the study of motion **without** considering the causes of motion (forces).  
It deals with **displacement, velocity, acceleration, and time**.

---

### Key Quantities

- **Displacement (s or Δx):** Change in position. Vector.
- **Velocity (v):** Rate of change of displacement. Vector.  
  $$ v = \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t} $$
- **Acceleration (a):** Rate of change of velocity. Vector.  
  $$ a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} $$

---

### Equations of Linear Motion (Constant Acceleration)

1. $$ v = u + at $$
   - Final velocity \(v\), initial velocity \(u\), acceleration \(a\), time \(t\).

2. $$ s = ut + \tfrac{1}{2}at^2 $$
   - Displacement \(s\).

3. $$ v^2 = u^2 + 2as $$
   - Velocity–displacement relation.

4. $$ s = \tfrac{(u+v)}{2} \cdot t $$
   - Displacement with average velocity.

---

### Free Fall (Special Case)

- Acceleration due to gravity: \( g \approx 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) (downward).
- Use the same kinematic equations, replacing \(a\) with \(g\).

---

**Example 1: Simple Acceleration**
A car starts from rest and accelerates at \( 3 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) for 5 seconds.  
Find its final velocity and displacement.

**Solution:**
- Final velocity:  
  $$ v = u + at = 0 + (3)(5) = 15 \, \text{m/s} $$
- Displacement:  
  $$ s = ut + \tfrac{1}{2}at^2 = 0 + \tfrac{1}{2}(3)(25) = 37.5 \, \text{m} $$

---

**Example 2: Free Fall**
An object is dropped from a height of 20 m. How long does it take to hit the ground?

**Solution:**
- Use \( s = \tfrac{1}{2} g t^2 \)  
  $$ 20 = \tfrac{1}{2}(9.8)t^2 $$
  $$ t^2 = \frac{40}{9.8} \approx 4.08 $$
  $$ t \approx 2.02 \, \text{seconds} $$

---

### Practice Problems

1. A ball is thrown upward with initial velocity \( u = 15 \, \text{m/s} \).  
   - How long before it reaches the highest point?  
   - What is the maximum height reached?  

2. A car moving at \( u = 25 \, \text{m/s} \) brakes with uniform deceleration \( a = -5 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).  
   - How long until it stops?  
   - What distance does it cover before stopping?  

3. A sprinter accelerates from rest to a speed of \( 10 \, \text{m/s} \) in 4 seconds.  
   - Find the acceleration.  
   - Find the distance covered in that time.  

---

### Laws to Remember

1. **Galileo’s Principle of Inertia:** Objects in uniform motion remain in uniform motion unless acted upon.
2. **Uniform Acceleration Laws:** The above 4 kinematic equations apply only when \(a\) is constant.
3. **Average vs Instantaneous Velocity:**
   - Average: $$ v_{avg} = \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t} $$
   - Instantaneous: slope of displacement–time curve at a point.
