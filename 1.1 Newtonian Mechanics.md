## 1.1 Newton's Law of Motion

---

### Newton's First Law of Motion (Law of Inertia)

**Statement:**  
An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion continues in motion at a constant velocity unless acted upon by a net external force.

**Equation:**  
There is no direct formula, but for constant velocity or rest:  

$$
\sum F = 0
$$

**Examples:**
- A book lying on a table stays at rest until someone pushes it.  
- A hockey puck sliding on ice eventually stops due to friction.  
- Passengers in a car lurch forward when the car suddenly stops (inertia).  

**Practice Problems:**  
1. A soccer ball is at rest on a field. A player kicks it with a force of 50 N. If no other forces act on it, what will happen to the ball according to Newton’s first law?  
2. Explain why passengers lurch forward in a car when it suddenly stops.  

---

### Newton's Second Law of Motion

**Statement:**  
The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.

**Equation:**  

$$
\vec{F} = m \vec{a}
$$

Where:  
- $F$ = net force (N)  
- $m$ = mass (kg)  
- $a$ = acceleration (m/s²)  

**Examples:**  
- A 10 kg box is pushed with a force of 20 N. Its acceleration is:  

$$
a = \frac{F}{m} = \frac{20}{10} = 2 \ \text{m/s}^2
$$

**Practice Problems:**  
1. A 5 kg object is accelerated at 4 m/s². Find the net force acting on it.  
2. A car of mass 800 kg accelerates at 2 m/s². What is the force applied?  
3. A 50 N force is applied on a 10 kg object. What is its acceleration?  

---

### Newton's Third Law of Motion

**Statement:**  
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

**Equation:**  

$$
F_{\text{action}} = -F_{\text{reaction}}
$$

**Examples:**  
- When you jump off a boat, the boat moves backward as you move forward.  
- A rocket pushes gases backward, and the rocket moves forward.  
- A swimmer pushes water backward with a force of 200 N, and the water pushes the swimmer forward with 200 N.  

**Practice Problems:**  
1. A swimmer pushes water backward with a force of 200 N. What is the force pushing the swimmer forward?  
2. Two ice skaters push each other away. Skater A has mass 50 kg, Skater B has mass 70 kg. If Skater A moves at 3 m/s, what is the speed of Skater B? *(Hint: use momentum conservation)*  

##   Momentum Shortcuts with Examples

### 1. Push-Apart from Rest (Simple Shortcut)
If two objects start at rest and push apart:

$$
v_B = \frac{m_A}{m_B} v_A
$$

* Then add a **negative sign** to show the opposite direction.  
- Works only when **initial momentum = 0**.

**Example:**  
Two skaters push off each other from rest.  
- Skater A: \(m_A = 30 \, \text{kg}\), \(v_A = +4 \, \text{m/s}\)  
- Skater B: \(m_B = 60 \, \text{kg}\), \(v_B = ?\)  

Solution:  
$$
v_B = \frac{30}{60}(4) = 2 \quad \Rightarrow v_B = -2 \, \text{m/s}
$$

---

### 2. Same Start Velocity, One Final Velocity Known
If two objects start moving together with velocity \(v_0\), and one final velocity is given:

$$
v_{\text{other}} = v_0 + \frac{m_{\text{known}}}{m_{\text{other}}} (v_0 - v_{\text{known final}})
$$

* Just take the initial velocity and **add the weighted share of the velocity change**.  

**Example:**  
A car (\(1000 \, \text{kg}\)) and trailer (\(500 \, \text{kg}\)) move together at \(20 \, \text{m/s}\).  
The trailer slows to \(10 \, \text{m/s}\).  
Find the car’s final velocity.  

Solution:  
$$
v_{\text{car}} = 20 + \frac{500}{1000}(20 - 10)
$$
$$
v_{\text{car}} = 20 + 0.5(10) = 25 \, \text{m/s}
$$

---

### 3. Throwing / Ejecting Something
If a person/astronaut throws an object while drifting:

$$
v_{\text{person final}} = v_0 + \frac{m_{\text{object}}}{m_{\text{person}}} (v_0 - v_{\text{object final}})
$$

* Same logic as above, but person vs object.  

**Example:**  
An astronaut (\(80 \, \text{kg}\)) drifts at \(+2 \, \text{m/s}\).  
He throws a \(20 \, \text{kg}\) tool backward at \(-5 \, \text{m/s}\).  
Find astronaut’s final velocity.  

Solution:  
$$
v_{\text{astronaut}} = 2 + \frac{20}{80}(2 - (-5))
$$
$$
v_{\text{astronaut}} = 2 + 0.25(7) = 2 + 1.75 = 3.75 \, \text{m/s}
$$

---

### 4. Collisions (Stick Together, Inelastic)
If two objects collide and stick together:

$$
v_{\text{final}} = \frac{m_A v_A + m_B v_B}{m_A + m_B}
$$

* This is just the **weighted average of their velocities**.  

**Example:**  
A \(2 \, \text{kg}\) cart moving at \(+3 \, \text{m/s}\) collides and sticks to a \(4 \, \text{kg}\) cart at rest.  
Find their final velocity.  

Solution:  
$$
v_{\text{final}} = \frac{2(3) + 4(0)}{2+4}
$$
$$
v_{\text{final}} = \frac{6}{6} = 1 \, \text{m/s}
$$

---

  **Pro Tip:**
- Use **Shortcut 1** for simple push-offs from rest.  
- Use **Shortcut 2/3** for cases with a shared start velocity.  
- Use **Shortcut 4** for collisions where they stick together.  
- If things get more complicated (elastic collisions with rebounds), go back to the **full momentum conservation law**.

## 1.2 Linear Motion / Kinematics


Kinematics is the study of motion **without** considering the causes of motion (forces).  
It deals with **displacement, velocity, acceleration, and time**.

---

### 1. Position, Displacement, and Distance  

**Statement:**  
- **Position** describes the location of an object relative to a reference point.  
- **Displacement** is the change in position (vector).  
- **Distance** is the total path length traveled (scalar).  

**Equation:**  
$$
\Delta x = x_f - x_i
$$  

**Examples:**  
- Walking 5 m east then 2 m west → displacement = +3 m, distance = 7 m.  
- A car drives 10 km north, then 10 km south → displacement = 0, distance = 20 km.  

**Practice Problems:**  
1. A runner moves from 0 m to 50 m east, then back to 20 m east. What is the total distance and displacement?  
2. A bus travels 12 km east and then 5 km west. Find the distance traveled and net displacement.  

---

### 2. Velocity  

**Statement:**  
Velocity is the rate of change of displacement with respect to time.  

**Equations:**  
- Average velocity:  
$$
v_{avg} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}
$$  

- Instantaneous velocity:  
$$
v = \frac{dx}{dt}
$$  

**Examples:**  
- A car moves 100 m in 20 s → average velocity = 5 m/s.  
- Position function: $x(t) = 4t^2$. Then $v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt} = 8t$.  

**Practice Problems:**  
1. A car travels 150 m in 30 s. What is its average velocity?  
2. If $x(t) = 3t^2 + 2t$, find $v(t)$.  

---

### 3. Acceleration  

**Statement:**  
Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time.  

**Equations:**  
- Average acceleration:  
$$
a_{avg} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}
$$  

- Instantaneous acceleration:  
$$
a = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}
$$  

**Examples:**  
- A car speeds up from 0 to 20 m/s in 5 s → acceleration = 4 m/s².  
- For $v(t) = 8t$, acceleration = 8 m/s² (constant).  

**Practice Problems:**  
1. A bike goes from 5 m/s to 15 m/s in 2 s. Find its acceleration.  
2. If $x(t) = 2t^3$, find acceleration.  

---

### 4. Equations of Motion (Constant Acceleration)  

**Statement:**  
If acceleration is constant, displacement and velocity can be related directly.  

**Equations:**  
1. $$v = v_0 + at$$  
2. $$x = x_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2$$  
3. $$v^2 = v_0^2 + 2 a (x - x_0)$$  
4. $$x = x_0 + \frac{1}{2} (v + v_0) t$$  

**Examples:**  
- A car starts from rest ($v_0 = 0$) with $a = 2 \, m/s^2$. After 5 s:  
  - $v = 10 \, m/s$  
  - $x = 25 \, m$  

**Practice Problems:**  
1. A ball is thrown upward with $v_0 = 20 \, m/s$. How high does it go?  
2. A car accelerates from 10 m/s to 25 m/s in 3 s. Find acceleration and displacement.  

---

### 5. Graphical Interpretation  

**Statement:**  
Graphs help visualize motion.  

- Slope of x–t graph → velocity  
- Slope of v–t graph → acceleration  
- Area under v–t graph → displacement  
- Area under a–t graph → change in velocity  

**Examples:**  
- Straight line in x–t graph → constant velocity  
- Linear v–t graph with slope → constant acceleration  

**Practice Problems:**  
1. Sketch the v–t graph of a car that starts at rest, accelerates uniformly for 5 s, then continues at constant speed for 5 s.  
2. If the area under the v–t graph is 40 m, what is the displacement?  

---

### 6. Free Fall and Gravity  

**Statement:**  
Objects near Earth’s surface accelerate downward at $g \approx 9.8 \, m/s^2$.  

**Equations:**  
- Use constant acceleration formulas with $a = -g$  

**Examples:**  
- Dropped object from rest after 2 s:  
  - $v = -19.6 \, m/s$  
  - $x = -19.6 \, m$  

**Practice Problems:**  
1. A ball is dropped from a height of 45 m. How long until it hits the ground?  
2. A rock is thrown upward at 15 m/s. How long until it comes back to the thrower’s hand?  

---

### 7. Relative Motion in One Dimension  

**Statement:**  
Motion depends on the reference frame.  

**Equation:**  
$$
v_{A/B} = v_A - v_B
$$  

**Examples:**  
- A bus moves at 20 m/s east. A passenger walks 2 m/s east relative to the bus → relative to ground = 22 m/s  
- If the passenger walked west, velocity relative to ground = 18 m/s  

**Practice Problems:**  
1. A train moves at 30 m/s. A person walks at 2 m/s opposite the train’s motion. What is their velocity relative to the ground?  
2. Two cars move east at 15 m/s and 25 m/s. What is the velocity of one car relative to the other?  

---

### 8. Reference Frames (Galilean Relativity)  

**Statement:**  
The laws of mechanics are the same in all inertial frames (frames not accelerating).  

**Transformation (1D):**  
$$
x' = x - vt , \quad t' = t
$$  

**Examples:**  
- A ball dropped inside a moving train falls vertically for both the passenger (inside frame) and someone outside (ground frame), though paths differ  

**Practice Problems:**  
1. A train moves at 10 m/s east. A passenger drops a ball. How does the trajectory look in the passenger’s frame vs. the ground frame?  
2. Apply the Galilean transformation for a particle at $x = 50 \, m$, $t = 5 \, s$ in a frame moving at 5 m/s east  

---

### 9. Work, Energy, and Momentum in Linear Motion  

**Statement:**  
Though part of dynamics, these link closely with kinematics  

**Equations:**  
- Kinetic energy: $$K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$$  
- Work-energy theorem: $$W = \Delta K$$  
- Momentum: $$p = m v$$  
- Impulse-momentum theorem: $$J = \Delta p = F \Delta t$$  

**Examples:**  
- A 2 kg ball moving at 3 m/s → momentum = 6 kg·m/s, kinetic energy = 9 J  

**Practice Problems:**  
1. A 1000 kg car accelerates from 10 m/s to 20 m/s. Find the change in kinetic energy  
2. A force of 50 N acts on a body for 4 s. Find the impulse and change in momentum  

---

### 10. Special Cases  

**Uniform Motion:**  
$$x = x_0 + v t$$  

**Uniform Acceleration:**  
- Use standard kinematic equations  

**Examples:**  
- Car at constant 10 m/s for 5 s → displacement = 50 m  

**Practice Problems:**  
1. A car at rest accelerates uniformly to 20 m/s in 10 s. Find displacement  
2. A body moves with constant velocity of 8 m/s for 6 s. Find displacement
