## 1.1 Newton's Law of Motion

---

### Newton's First Law of Motion (Law of Inertia)

**Statement:**  
An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion continues in motion at a constant velocity unless acted upon by a net external force.

**Equation:**  
There is no direct formula, but for constant velocity or rest:  

$$
\sum F = 0
$$

**Examples:**
- A book lying on a table stays at rest until someone pushes it.  
- A hockey puck sliding on ice eventually stops due to friction.  
- Passengers in a car lurch forward when the car suddenly stops (inertia).  

**Practice Problems:**  
1. A soccer ball is at rest on a field. A player kicks it with a force of 50 N. If no other forces act on it, what will happen to the ball according to Newton’s first law?  
2. Explain why passengers lurch forward in a car when it suddenly stops.

### Newton's Second Law of Motion

**Statement:**  
The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.

**Equation:**  

$$
\vec{F} = m \vec{a}
$$

Where:  
- $F$ = net force (N)  
- $m$ = mass (kg)  
- $a$ = acceleration (m/s²)  

**Examples:**  
- A 10 kg box is pushed with a force of 20 N. Its acceleration is:  

$$
a = \frac{F}{m} = \frac{20}{10} = 2 \ \text{m/s}^2
$$

**Practice Problems:**  
1. A 5 kg object is accelerated at 4 m/s². Find the net force acting on it.  
2. A car of mass 800 kg accelerates at 2 m/s². What is the force applied?  
3. A 50 N force is applied on a 10 kg object. What is its acceleration?

### Newton's Third Law of Motion

**Statement:**  
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

**Equation:**  

$$
F_{\text{action}} = -F_{\text{reaction}}
$$

**Examples:**  
- When you jump off a boat, the boat moves backward as you move forward.  
- A rocket pushes gases backward, and the rocket moves forward.  
- A swimmer pushes water backward with a force of 200 N, and the water pushes the swimmer forward with 200 N.  

**Practice Problems:**  
1. A swimmer pushes water backward with a force of 200 N. What is the force pushing the swimmer forward?  
2. Two ice skaters push each other away. Skater A has mass 50 kg, Skater B has mass 70 kg. If Skater A moves at 3 m/s, what is the speed of Skater B? *(Hint: use momentum conservation)*  

## Momentum Shortcuts

### 1. Push-Apart from Rest (Simple Shortcut)
If two objects start at rest and push apart:

$$
v_B = \frac{m_A}{m_B} v_A
$$

* Then add a **negative sign** to show the opposite direction.  
- Works only when **initial momentum = 0**.  
- This was the intuitive formula we derived earlier.  

---

### 2. Same Start Velocity, One Final Velocity Known
If two objects start moving together with velocity \(v_0\), and one final velocity is given:

$$
v_{\text{other}} = v_0 + \frac{m_{\text{known}}}{m_{\text{other}}} (v_0 - v_{\text{known final}})
$$

* Just take the initial velocity and **add the weighted share of the velocity change**.  
- Faster than grinding the conservation equation.  

---

### 3. Throwing / Ejecting Something
If a person/astronaut throws an object while drifting:

$$
v_{\text{person final}} = v_0 + \frac{m_{\text{object}}}{m_{\text{person}}} (v_0 - v_{\text{object final}})
$$

* Same logic as above, but person vs object.  
- Example: astronaut tossing a tool in space.  

---

### 4. Collisions (Stick Together, Inelastic)
If two objects collide and stick together:

$$
v_{\text{final}} = \frac{m_A v_A + m_B v_B}{m_A + m_B}
$$

* This is just the **weighted average of their velocities**.  
- Works for perfectly inelastic collisions.  

---

  **Key Notes**
- Use **Shortcut 1** for simple push-offs from rest.  
- Use **Shortcut 2/3** for cases with a shared start velocity.  
- Use **Shortcut 4** for collisions where they stick together.  
- If things get more complicated (e.g., elastic collisions with bounces), go back to the **full momentum conservation law**.
